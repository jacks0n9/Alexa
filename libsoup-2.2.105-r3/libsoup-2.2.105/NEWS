Changes in libsoup from 2.2.104 to 2.2.105:

	* Fixed a crash-when-idle that affected evolution-exchange
          [#437835] and rhythmbox [#506552].

	* Added the API version to the gtk-doc installation dir, to
          prevent parallel-installation problems with libsoup 2.2 and
          2.4. [#512810, Daniel Gryniewicz].

	With the upcoming release of libsoup 2.4.0 as part of GNOME
	2.22, libsoup 2.2 is becoming deprecated, and there will
	probably not be any further releases in the 2.2 series.
	Applications that use libsoup should start looking into
	porting to the exciting and fun libsoup-2.4 API. A porting
	guide is available at
	http://library.gnome.org/devel/libsoup/unstable/libsoup-porting-2.2-2.4.html.
	If you have questions not answered by that document, please
	send mail to libsoup-list@gnome.org.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.103 to 2.2.104:

	* soup_message_io_pause() and soup_message_io_pause() are now
	  allowed for client messages (and in particular, they don't
	  mess up when called from the "got_chunk" callback).
	  [#452280, Marco Barisione]

	* Fixed some bugs in SOUP_SESSION_ASYNC_CONTEXT support that
	  would cause parts of an operation to run in the default
	  context rather than the session's context. Also fixed some
	  leaks and added a regression test. [#498509, Wouter
	  Cloetens]

	* There is a new test/sample program, tests/pull-api.c,
	  showing how to implement a pull API using SoupSessionAsync.
	  (This depends on the fixes for #452280 and #498509, so it
	  won't work with older versions of libsoup.)

	* Discovered "valgrind --leak-resolution=med" and fixed some
          more memory leaks.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.102 to 2.2.103:

	* Fix memory corruption in SoupSessionAsync that caused
          rhythmbox to crash. [#484988, patch from Rob Bradford]

	* Fix socket refcounting in SoupServer to fix warnings /
          possible crash. [#459896, Emanuele Aina]

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.101 to 2.2.102:

	* Unbreak the build when building without SSL. Not that you
          should be building without SSL anyway, but... (reported by
          guenther).

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.100 to 2.2.101:

	* Fix build on cygwin [384498]

	* Fix SSL rehandshaking on synchronous sockets [415402, Jacob
          Berkman] and add a regression test for it.

	* Fix two bugs in https tunnels over proxies that require
	  authentication (noticed by Varadhan), and add a regression
	  test for them.

	* Ensure that if you queue multiple messages at once to an
	  http server that requires authentication but that you
	  haven't authenticated to yet, that all of the messages get
	  properly authenticated [271540, James Willcox]. And add a
	  regression test for it.

	* Fix NTLM authentication, which got broken by the previous
          fix. [471389, Varadhan]. Add a basic NTLM regression test
          that doesn't really test the crypto/encoding parts, but at
          least makes sure that the message flow is correct.

	* Allow trailing whitespace after HTTP version in
          Response-Line, for compatibility with broken servers
          [475169, Stephane Loeuillet]. Add that case to the
          header-parsing regression test.

	* Fix crash when the session's "authenticate" handler returns
	  a username and no password when using NTLM. [480987, Wendell
	  MacKenzie]

	* Use "new" glib base64 and iso8601 methods rather than
          duplicating them. [337010, patch from Emmanuele Bassi].

	* Implement soup_session_queue_message() for SoupSessionSync.

	* Add G_BEGIN_DECLS / G_END_DECLS to all headers that were
          missing them. [438776, patch from Jonathon Jongsma].

	* Fix broken definition of SOUP_IS_MESSAGE_FILTER_CLASS. Noted
          by "cascardo" on libsoup-list.

	* Remove documentation of non-public MD5 methods [440092,
          Jonathon Jongsma]. Removed a mysterious half-sentence in the
          SoupMessage docs [458116, Marco Barisione].

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.99 to 2.2.100:

	* Fixed soup_headers_parse_status_line() so WebDAV response
          parsing will work again. [406997]

	* Fixed a bug in the header-parsing regression test that
          caused the test to fail sometimes, even though the actual
          header-parsing code was fine.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.98 to 2.2.99:

	* Fixed header parsing, including a crash in SoupServer with
          certain malformed requests [391970].

	* Fixed redirection to other hosts with SoupSessionAsync.
          [382251]

	* Fixed a small memory leak pointed out by Chris Austin.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.97 to 2.2.98:

	* The XML-RPC code now correctly interprets <value>foo</value>
	  as meaning the same thing as
	  <value><string>foo</string></value>. [364490] Pointed out by
	  Todd Kulesza.

	* Memory leak fixes from Andrew W. Nosenko.

	* A few symbols that should have been static before now are.
	  [376387] Patch from Matthias Clasen.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.96 to 2.2.97:

	* Fixed SOAP and XML-RPC code to handle whitespace and
          comments in the XML better. (Based on a patch from Andrew W.
          Nosenko.)

	* Fixed lots of typecasting/constness warnings in the code
          (mostly via a patch from Andrew W. Nosenko)

	* Fixed build on Cygwin [321827]

	* Fixed libsoup-2.2.pc fields [343340] and make it get
          uninstalled correctly [356809]. (Mikhail Zabaluev and
          Matthew Barnes)

	* Fixed some small leaks in SoupServer pointed out by Paolo
          Borelli. [351500]

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.95.1 to 2.2.96:

	* SoupServer now works even if you don't explicitly set an
	  encoding for the response. (In particular, the automatic 404
	  if you request a path with no handlers now works. Problem
	  pointed out by Dennis Jacobfeuerborn.)

	* WWW-Authenticate and Proxy-Authenticate responses with no
          realm parameter are now ignored, as per RFC 2617, fixing a
          crash pointed out by Nate Nielsen.

	* Added soup_xmlrpc_message_from_string(), from Fernando
          Herrera [348532].

	* simple-httpd and "get" now support HEAD

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.94 to 2.2.95.1:

	* Even more fixes to XML-RPC, found by the new XML-RPC
          regression test. This includes some API changes that I don't
          feel guilty about, because the code totally didn't work at
          all before.

	* Fixed a bug in soup_mktime_utc()

	* (2.2.95 was identical to 2.2.95.1. The only difference is
	  that the shared library version was belatedly bumped from
	  8.2.0 to 8.3.0 to reflect the API "additions")

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.93 to 2.2.94:

	* Various fixes to the XML-RPC code (which apparently had not
	  actually ever worked before) from Brent Smith. [343973,
	  344222, 344458]

	* Added client and server API tutorials to the docs

	* auth-test now uses a local Apache 2.2 install, if possible,
          rather than depending on files that used to be on an old
          Ximian web server but haven't been anywhere for a long time.
	  [311825]

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.92 to 2.2.93:

	* Fixed outgoing data corruption caused when SoupServer
          started writing out a response a second time after already
          having started once. [334469]. Also fixed 342640 and another
          bug caused by the workaround for 334469 in 2.2.92. Based on
          patches and analysis from William Jon McCann and Armin
          Bauer.

	* Fixed a deadlock when changing a session's proxy URI.
          [309867 / bnc 174255, based on a patch by Veerapuram
          Varadhan].

	* Fixed https-via-proxies in the synchronous case. [bnc 174255]

	* Fixed a crash in evolution-exchange [342545, fix based on an
          analysis by Wang Xin].

	* Fixed simple-proxy to not crash at startup. Oops. (Alex
          Larsson)

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.91 to 2.2.92:

	* Fixed server-side digest auth to return a valid "algorithm"
	  value and client-side to not crash if it sees an invalid one
	  [328615].

	* Fixed the Request-Line parsing code to not hardcode a
          maximum URI length (to allow very long DAAP requests from
          iTunes in Rhythmbox). [335040]

	* Fixed some warnings (signed/unsigned mismatch).

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.7 to 2.2.91:

	* (The large version number bump is because there was an
	  internal 2.2.90 release for SUSE 10.1 alphas, which was
	  supposed to be intermediate between 2.2.7 and 2.4.0. But
	  2.4.0 didn't end up happening, and I don't want to regress
	  the version number at this point.)

	* SoupSession, SoupServer, SoupConnection, SoupSocket, and
          SoupAddress now have an "async-context" property that allows
          you to use the async API in a non-default GMainContext.
          [Based on patches from Armin Bauer and JÃ¼rg Billeter.]

	* SoupSession, SoupConnection, and SoupSocket now have a
          "timeout" property to stop synchronous sockets from hanging
          forever if the remote end is unresponsive (from Varadhan).

	* Fixed some bugs in soup_date_iso8601_parse(). [324671, from
          Emmanuele Bassi]

	* More Windows build fixes from Tor.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.6.1 to 2.2.7:

	* Fixed a crash when using NTLM connections [316313, probably
	  also 318252]. (Also 321208, which was a bug introduced in
	  the original fix for 316313.)

	* Fixed a bug that could cause soup to suck up all available
          CPU when a connection to a SoupServer was dropped by the
          other side [319305, patch from Jonathan Matthew]

	* Fixed the creation of struct elements in XMLRPC messages
	  [321362, patch from Sebastian Bauer]

	* Plugged a small memory leak in SoupSocket (from Wang Xin).

	* Fixed two compile problems, a gccism [320349, patch from
          Roland Illig], and a strict-aliasing warning from gcc 4.1.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.6 to 2.2.6.1:

	* Fixed a crash when using SoupSoapMessage

Changes from 2.2.5 to 2.2.6:

	* Fixed a crash when canceling a message (from Tambet Ingo)

	* Fixed a bug where a connection could be leaked forever in
          some circumstances if a request got a 30x, 401, or 407
          response, eventually causing a hang when the session hit its
          maximum connection limit. (Dan/Tambet)

	* Fixed a memory leak. (Tambet)

	* Fixed a bug that would sometimes show up when connecting to
	  a server on localhost [#312540]

	* Added some API to SoupServer and SoupSocket to help fix a
          long-standing rcd bug.

Changes from 2.2.4 to 2.2.5:

	* Win32 support (from Tor Lillqvist)

	* Up-to-date API documentation pretty much everywhere

	* Basic XMLRPC support (from Mariano Suarez-Alvarez, Fernando
	  Herrera, and Jeff Bailey)

	* New HTTP timestamp-manipulation methods soup_date_parse,
	  soup_date_generate, and soup_date_iso8601_parse.

	* SoupSession now handles relative URLs in the Location header
          (in violation of RFC 2616, but in line with how some servers
          behave.) [270688]

Changes from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4:

	* Fixed a problem with NTLM authentication against
	  multi-domain servers. [306877]

	* Fixed DNS lookups on Solaris. [254551, 268389]

Changes from 2.2.2 to 2.2.3:

	* Now compiles against gnutls 1.2.0 [257811]

	* Fixed a bug that could result in 100% CPU usage if an SSL
	  server closed the connection uncleanly. [273352]

Changes from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2:

	* The SSL validation fix from 2.2.1 [264414] is now completely
          fixed. (Part of the fix didn't actually make it into 2.2.1)

	* HTTPS certificate validation now works when using an HTTP
          proxy. [268583]

	* HTTP proxy code deals better with proxies that try to make
          the user do HTML-form-based authentication. [268531]

	* 64-bit fixes for NTLM auth code. [270323, from Michael
          Zucchi]

Changes from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1:

	* Updated for a libgcrypt API change between 1.1.9x and 1.2.x
          that caused a crash at runtime if you compiled against
          1.2.x. [266342]

	* SSL certificate validation failure should now always result
          in a status of SOUP_STATUS_SSL_FAILED, rather than getting
          turned into SOUP_STATUS_IO_ERROR. [264414]


Changes in libsoup from the 2.0 series (1.99.x versions) to 2.2:

	* Most of the libsoup datatypes are now GObjects. (SoupUri
	  is currently an exception to this.)

		* SoupMessage now emits signals at various stages of
	          processing. (Eg, "wrote_body", "got_headers".) (You
	          can also still use soup_message_add_*handler().)

	* SoupContexts are gone; soup_message_new() now takes a URI
	  string.

	* All formerly global state is now maintained by the
          SoupSession object. (This includes the connection pool,
          proxy server, cached authentication information, SSL
          certificates, etc.)

		* You can create a SoupSessionAsync (for 2.0-like
		  behavior) or SoupSessionSync (for blocking,
		  synchronous usage).

		* You can add SoupMessageFilter objects to a session
                  to have certain processing automatically performed
                  on every message sent via that session. (Eg, setting
                  up handlers.)

		* NTLM authentication is no longer supported by
	          default. You must enable it by setting the
		  SOUP_SESSION_USE_NTLM flag on the session.

		* The preferred method of handling authentication is
	          now via the "authenticate" and "reauthenticate"
	          signals on SoupSession. (The old style, of encoding
	          the user and password information into the url is
	          also still supported.)

	* The SOUP_ERROR_* values are now SOUP_STATUS_* (so that we
          don't have "SOUP_ERROR_OK" and the like).

		* SOUP_MESSAGE_IS_ERROR() is gone, since some cases
		  want to include 3xx responses and some don't.

		* SOUP_ERROR_CANT_AUTHENTICATE and
                  SOUP_ERROR_CANT_AUTHENTICATE_PROXY are now gone,
                  since they didn't carry any information that
                  SOUP_STATUS_UNAUTHORIZED and
                  SOUP_STATUS_PROXY_UNAUTHORIZED don't.

		* DNS errors now show up as the new status code
		  SOUP_STATUS_CANT_RESOLVE rather than being mixed in
		  with SOUP_ERROR_CANT_CONNECT.

	* Minimal SOAP support has been added back, via
          SoupSoapMessage/SoupSoapResponse

	* The HTTP I/O state machine was completely rewritten, fixing
	  numerous crashes, leaks, and protocol errors.

	* SoupUri now conforms to RFC 2396. Mostly.

	* Various test programs have been added under tests/

	* Removed:

		* Support for OpenSSL (which was horribly buggy) and
		  Mozilla NSS (which was never finished). We only
		  support GNUTLS for SSL now.

		* SOCKS support

		* CGI support in SoupServer
