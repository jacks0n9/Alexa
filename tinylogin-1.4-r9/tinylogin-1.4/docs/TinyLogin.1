.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
TinyLogin is a suite of tiny Unix utilities for handling logging into,
being authenticated by, changing one's password for, and otherwise
maintaining users and groups on an embedded system. It also provides
shadow password support to enhance system security. TinyLogin is, as the
name implies, very small, and makes an excellent complement to BusyBox
on an embedded System. It can be used without BusyBox, of course, but I
envision them being used together most of the time.
.PP
Why is something like TinyLogin useful?

`nuff said.
.PP
TinyLogin is a curious blend of code from a whole bunch of folks. It
was originally cobbled together by Sean Bastille <hightide@ginch.org>
based in part on the May of 1998 version of the shadow utilities, which
can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.ists.pwr.wroc.pl/pub/linux/shadow/
The build system, and the way in which TinyLogin invokes its component
applications has been totally rewritten, based on the build system used
for BusyBox. The code has also been majorly reworked to make it more
internally consistent, to make it use fewer global variables, etc, by
Erik Andersen.
.PP
TinyLogin may be used and distributed under the terms of \s-1GNU\s0 General
Public License, with the addition of the special terms enumerated below
by the shadow utilities license (a \s-1BSD\s0 style license which allows me
to make future releases under the \s-1GPL\s0).
.Sh "\s-1HACKING\s0"
.IX Subsection "HACKING"
TinyLogin, like BusyBox, is now modularized to easily allow you to build only
the components you need, thereby reducing binary size. To turn off unwanted
TinyLogin components, simply edit the file Config.h and comment out the parts
you do not want using \*(C+ style (//) comments.
.PP
After the build is complete a tinylogin.links file is generated which is
then used by 'make install' to create symlinks to the tinylogin binary
for all compiled in functions. By default, 'make install' will place a
symlink forest into `pwd`/_install unless you have defined the \s-1PREFIX\s0
environment variable.
.SH "MAKING IT WORK"
.IX Header "MAKING IT WORK"
I often get email from people wondering why tinylogin doesn't work.  It is
almost always the case that they compiled with \*(L"\s-1USE_SYSTEM_PWD_GRP\s0 = true\*(R" in
the Makefile, and they are using \s-1GNU\s0 Libc, and have either failed to install
/etc/nsswitch.conf, have badly configured their /etc/nsswitch.conf file, or
have a properly configured /etc/nsswitch.conf file but have not installed the
libraries the \s-1GNU\s0 Libc is looking for (which is determined based on the
contents of the /etc/nsswitch.conf file).  To avoid these problems, I recommend
that unless you have a very good reason, you should always leave the Makefile's
\&\*(L"\s-1USE_SYSTEM_PWD_GRP\s0 = false\*(R" setting in place.  This will cause tinylogin to
directly use the system's password and group files.  This way, you do not need
to worry about \s-1GNU\s0 Libc's \s-1NSS\s0 at all (thereby making your embedded system even
smaller).  If you absolutely must use \s-1GNU\s0 libc \s-1NSS\s0 for authentication you must
include something such as the following in your embedded systems'
/etc/nsswitch.conf file:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  # /etc/nsswitch.conf
\&  # Note that if you are doing networking, 
\&  # other entries will also be needed.
\&  passwd:         compat
\&  group:          compat
\&  shadow:         compat
.Ve
Furthermore, you will also need to include the library /lib/libnss_compat so
that \s-1GNU\s0 Libc can find it when it is needed (it is dynamicaly loaded, so 'ldd'
won't tell you that you need it \*(-- which is why I've devoted this entire
section of the manual to tell you you need it).  If you want to do something
more complicated, such as authenticating vs a remote \s-1LDAP\s0 database, well
tinylogin can work just fine with that type of setup using \s-1GNU\s0 libc \s-1NSS\s0, but
setting it up is your problem, not mine.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
Currently defined functions include:
.PP
adduser, addgroup, deluser, delgroup, login, su, sulogin,
passwd, getty
.IP "\(bu adduser" 4
.IX Item "adduser"
Add a user to the system
.Sp
Usage:  adduser [\s-1OPTIONS\s0]... <\s-1USER\s0>
.Sp
Options:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  -h <directory>    specify home directory
\&  -s <shell>        specify shell
\&  -g <gecos>        specify GECOS string
.Ve
Default values are as follows:  
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  HOME=/home/$USER
\&  SHELL=/bin/sh
\&  GECOS="Embedix,,,"
.Ve
Description:
.Sp
This utility adds a user to /etc/passwd and /etc/group.  If
shadow is enabled /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow are also updated
w/ appropriate information.  The group name is set to the same
value as the user name.  To set the initial password, adduser
executes passwd which presents an interactive prompt.  This
makes adduser inappropriate for batch account creation.
.Sp
Normally, something like adduser is implemented in a scripting
language, but this one was implemented in C.  The rationale for
this was that in a small system, one might not have space for
certain Unix shell utilities that are normally taken for granted
or that one might not have space for even a minimal perl
installation.  Such limitations could make making a robust
adduser implementation difficult, so the only viable option left
was to do it in C.
.Sp
When implementing adduser, the semantics of Debian's adduser
perl script were used as a reference, so those of you familiar
with that should notice similarities.
.IP "\(bu addgroup" 4
.IX Item "addgroup"
Add a group to the system
.Sp
Usage:  addgroup [\s-1OPTIONS\s0]... <\s-1GROUP\s0>
.Sp
Options:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  -g <number>       specify gid
.Ve
Description:
.Sp
This utility adds a group to /etc/group and if necessary,
/etc/gshadow as well.  If the \s-1GID\s0 is not specified, addgroup
will try to find the next available gid within the range of 
[100..64000].
.IP "\(bu deluser" 4
.IX Item "deluser"
Delete a user from the system
.Sp
Usage:  deluser <\s-1USER\s0>
.Sp
Description:
.Sp
This utility only takes one parameter which is the user name.
It will search /etc/passwd and delete the user's account if it
exists.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR:  Although adduser adds both users and groups,
deluser only deletes users.
.IP "\(bu delgroup" 4
.IX Item "delgroup"
Delete a group from the system
.Sp
Usage:  delgroup <\s-1USER\s0>
.Sp
Description:
.Sp
This utility only takes one parameter which is the group name.
It will search /etc/group and delete the group if it exists.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR:  Although adduser adds both users and groups,
delgroup only deletes groups.
.IP "\(bu login" 4
.IX Item "login"
Begin session on the system
.Sp
Usage:  login
.IP "\(bu su" 4
.IX Item "su"

Single-user login
.IP "\(bu passwd" 4
.IX Item "passwd"
Change user password
.IP "\(bu getty" 4
