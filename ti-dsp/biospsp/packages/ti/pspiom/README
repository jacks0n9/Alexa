Contained in this README are the quickstart step to build the biospsp framework


Modules Available 
=================

i2c       - driver to communicate over i2c bus
prcm      - driver to control PRCM module for peripheral clock enable/disable
mcbsp     - mcbsp driver
platforms - platform specific libraries
mcbsp_sample_master - example mcbsp application (master mode)
mcbsp_sample_master - example mcbsp application (slave mode)


Note: This package depends on software components in the DVSDK.  Please install the dvsdk before attempting to
build the biospsp framework (http://www.ti.com/tool/linuxdvsdk-dm37x)


1) Modify the following variable in the file Rules.make
     DVSDK_INSTALL_DIR  - specify the root path of DVSDK  (i.e. DVSDK_INSTALL_DIR = <root path>/ti-dvsdk_dm3730-evm_04_03_00_06 
     MY_INSTALL_ROOT    - specify the root path of dsp software  (i.e. MY_INSTALL_ROOT = <dsp root path>/dsp

2) make clean
3) make all

The sample application binary should be created.  This image can be loaded onto the DSP using CCS5 and executed.
