 *  ======== package.xdc ========
 *  Simple Codec Engine compatible speech 1.0 "decoder", wrapping the speech
 *  1.0 encode copy codec distributed with xDAIS.
 *
 *  This codec illustrates the simplest integration into the Codec
 *  Engine.  Only three files are required to integrate into the codec engine:
 *  @p(dlist)
 *      - `package.xdc`
 *          This file is required to declare a name for this package and to
 *          list all codec interfaces available.
 *      - `L16PCMDEC.xdc`
 *          This file specifies a codec (named L16PCMDEC) that is
 *          provided by this package.
 *      - `L16PCMDEC.xs`
 *          This file implements the functions required by the ICodec
 *          interface; these functions enable the codec to describe its
 *          non-functional requirements such as stack size.
 *
 *  Integration into the Codec Engine requires no change to the codecs
 *  libraries.
